    title: "Sticky Hidden Markov Model for Financial Regime Detection",
    description: "Implemented a custom Sticky Hidden Markov Model from scratch using log-space Expectation-Maximization and Viterbi decoding to identify market regimes in financial time series. Added sticky transition regularization to reduce regime chatter and validated with log-likelihood and persistence metrics. Strengthened skills in probabilistic modeling and algorithmic sequence analysis.",

    description: "Independently designed and executed a study analyzing how in-context learning (ICL) affects mathematical reasoning in small language models. Built evaluation pipelines comparing zero-shot and few-shot prompting, analyzed performance trends, and communicated findings through a poster and report. Strengthened skills in experimental design, evaluation, and interpreting LLM behavior.",

    description: "Built a multilayer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy to forecast weather conditions from historical time-series data. Implemented forward/backward propagation manually, using GeLU activations, residual connections, and L2 regularization to improve generalization. Strengthened understanding of neural network fundamentals and time-series modeling.",
